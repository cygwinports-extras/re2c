ldesc: "re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. 
Unlike any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient 
code for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much 
broader range of use than any traditional lexer offers. And last but not 
least re2c generates warning free code that is equal to hand-written 
code in terms of size, speed and quality."
